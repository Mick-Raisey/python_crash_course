# 2. at least 2 years old but less than 4, print a message that the person is a toddler.
# 3. 4 years old but less than 13, print a message that the person is a kid.
# 4. 13 years old but less than 20, the person is a teenager.
# 5. between 20 and 65, the person is an adult.
# 6. 65 or older, print a message that the person is an elder.
