# Choose a color for an alien as you did in Exercise 5-3,
# and write an if-else chain.

# 1 If the alien’s color is green, print a statement that the player just earned 5
#   points for shooting the alien.
# 2 If the alien’s color isn’t green, print a statement that the player just earned
#   10 points.
# 3 Write one version of this program that runs the if block and another that
#   runs the else block.
