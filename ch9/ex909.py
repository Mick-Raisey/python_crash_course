# 9-9. Battery Upgrade: Use the final version of electric_car.py from this section.
# Add a method to the Battery class called upgrade_battery(). This method
# should check the battery size and set the capacity to 65 if it isn't already. Make
# an electric car with a default battery size, call get_range() once, and then
# call get_range() a second time after upgrading the battery. You should see an
# increase in the car's range.
